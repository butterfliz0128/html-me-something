        <p class="story">My education started in the small town of Dixon, Missouri at Dixon High School.
           I have always enjoyed school and learning.  My main interests were in the areas of math and science,
           so I knew I wanted to find a career focused along those lines.  Having an older sister who worked
           in what was called "Data Processing" back in those days convinced me to pursue a degree in Computer
           Science.  She lived in St. Louis, so I moved up to the big city (STL) to go to college at
           University of Missouri - St. Louis.  When I got there, I realized it was more of a business
           school, so I decided to change to Business Administration with an emphasis in Management 
           Information Systems and Finance. </p>
           
        <p class="story">
           My sophomore year, I landed a co-op job with McDonnell Douglas.
           This was the start of my IT Career.  Before my co-op gig ended, I was hired as a full-time employee.
           I have been a business programmer analyst for 3 major companies for 20+ years.  Most of experience
           is with COBOL and the mainframe which is why I decided to do LaunchCode - want to learn web
           development!
